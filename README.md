# reinforcement-learning-tic-tac-toe

## Description:

This project contains the implementation of an agent which learns to play tic tac toe using Q-learning. The agent learns by playing against another player in simulation and the found policy is stored and later loaded when playing against the human player.


## Requirements
reinforcement-learning-DeepQNetwork requires the following to run: 
* ```Python3```
* ```numpy ```
* ```pickle```

## Run instructions:

* This project can be run via the command line using the command ```python3 main.py``` . When you want to retrain the agent, simply press 'Y'. Afterwards for setting the 'O' in the tic tac toe game the player has to choose both row and column (both ranging from 0 to 2).
